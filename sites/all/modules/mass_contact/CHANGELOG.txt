2008-02-22 Jason Flatt drupal@oadaeh.net
  * mass_contact.module: Modified the help text displayed for tokens to only
    show global tokens as nothing else will work at the time the tokens are
    being applied. In order to get user tokens to work, all messages would
    have to be sent out one-at-a-time to each recipient.

2008-02-17 Jason Flatt drupal@oadaeh.net
  * mass_contact.module: Changed how attachments are handled if Mime Mail is
    installed.

2008-01-23 Jason Flatt drupal@oadaeh.net
  * mass_contact.module: Made SQL query change for PostgreSQL: compatibility.
    Issue and fix reported by larsfp here: http://drupal.org/node/198778
    Changed attachment save operation from FILE_EXISTS_REPLACE to
    FILE_EXISTS_RENAME.
    Changed the help text to work with POT extractor as reported by skizzo
    here: http://drupal.org/node/176345

2008-01-22 Jason Flatt drupal@oadaeh.net
  * mass_contact.module: Removed the code to check for the SMTP module.
    Changed the recipients' e-mail addresses from $rnamea ." <". $rmaila .">"
    to $rmaila.
    Modified the way the attachment is added to the message.
    Changed the way the attachment is saved with the node to address
    http://drupal.org/node/155229.

2007-11-11 Jason Flatt drupal@oadaeh.net
  * mass_contact.module: Changed the default value for showing the opt-out
    check box from true to false.

2007-11-02 Jason Flatt drupal@oadaeh.net
  * mass_contact.module: Commented out the SMTP Auth. module specific code.

2007-10-31 Jason Flatt drupal@oadaeh.net
  * mass_contact.module: Removed denugging line, thanks to this notice:
    http://drupal.org/node/188308

2007-10-20 Jason Flatt drupal@oadaeh.net
  * mass_contact.module: Removed a forgotten extrapolation where the Token
    module was being used.

2007-09-12 Jason Flatt drupal@oadaeh.net
  * mass_contact.module: Fixed the fact that multiple categories were not
    being mailed to (which is what delayed the previous changes from getting
    into CVS).
    Fixed two places (in the area where there is a limit on the number of
    recipients) where I was not checking for a valid header before sending the
    e-mail. Thanks to sharplesa for alerting me to this oversight:
    http://drupal.org/node/173987
    Removed translation functions in areas that didn't work, as reported by
    skizzo in this comment: http://drupal.org/node/145940#comment-284484
  * TODO.txt: Added for notes and reminders on things to do.

2007-09-01 Jason Flatt drupal@oadaeh.net
  * CHANGELOG.txt: Added.
  * mass_contact.module: The community has spoken: reverting all constants to
    upper case.
    Removed an uncessary validation check in mass_contact_admin_edit_validate.
    Added periods at the end of a few sentences.
    Moved code to inform user about node creation inside the check to do it in
    the first place.
    Changed the way creating categories works so that multiple categories can
    be selected by default, and the mail page will respect those choices.
    Added the two feature requests listed here: http://drupal.org/node/170837,
    namely, hiding the categories checkbox, if there is only one category, and
    it is set as selected, and showing descriptive text instead of the BCC
    checkbox, if users are not allowed to change the setting.
    Rearranged the admin settings and the mail page, so that they flowed more
    like a standard e-mail sending form.
    Tweaked a few things here and there (text, punctuation, etc.).
    Added more commenting to the code. There's still more to do.
    Probably some other stuff I forgot about.  :^)  (This was supposed to be a
    quick change to a couple of things that ended up being a much bigger
    update that took a lot longer.)
