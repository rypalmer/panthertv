-- SUMMARY --

Drupal Administration Menu displays the whole menu tree below /admin including
most local tasks in a drop-down menu. So administrators need less time
to access pages which are only visible after one or two clicks normally.

Admin menu also provides hook_admin_menu() that allows other modules to add or
alter menu items.

-- REQUIREMENTS --

None.


-- INSTALLATION --

* Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information.


-- CONFIGURATION --

* Configure user permissions in Administer >> User management >> Access control
  >> admin_menu module:

  - access administration menu: Displays Drupal Administration Menu.

  - display drupal links: Displays additional links to Drupal.org and issue
    queues of all enabled contrib modules in the Drupal Administration Menu icon.

  Please bear in mind that the displayed menu items in Drupal Administration Menu
  depend on the actual permissions of a user.  For example, if a user does not
  have the permission 'administer access control' and 'administer users', the
  whole 'User management' menu item will not be displayed.

* Customize module settings in Administer >> Site configuration >> Administration
  Menu.


-- CUSTOMIZATION --

* You have two options to override the admin menu icon:

  1) Disable it via CSS in your theme:
<code>
body #admin-menu-icon { display: none; }
</code>

  2) Alter the image by overriding the theme function:

     Copy the whole function theme_admin_menu_icon() into your template.php,
     rename it to f.e. phptemplate_admin_menu_icon() and customize the output
     according to your needs.

  Please bear in mind that admin_menu's output is cached. You need to clear your
  site's cache (probably best using Devel module, or by manually truncating the
  cache_menu database table) to see any changes of your theme override function.

* You can override the font size by adding a line to your stylesheet in your
  theme like the following:
<code>
body #admin-menu { font-size: 10px; }
</code>


-- TROUBLESHOOTING --

* If admin menu is not displayed, check the following steps:

  - Is the 'access administration menu' permission enabled?

  - Does your theme output $closure? (See FAQ below for more info)

* If admin menu is rendered behind a flash movie object, you need to add the
  following property to your flash object(s):
<code>
<param name="wmode" value="transparent" />
</code>
  See http://drupal.org/node/195386 for further information.


-- FAQ --

Q: Content management >> Create content items are not displayed, although the
   user has been granted access to create content. Why?

A: This issue is caused by the circumstance that no other administrative menu
   item below Content management is visible for the user. Because of that,
   Drupal does not render this menu grouping item at all, and admin_menu is
   therefore not able to add the items below Create content.

   If you grant just one other permission for that user role, for example
   'administer taxonomy', the whole Content management item should show up.

Q: When admin_menu is enabled, plenty of blank space is added to the bottom of
   my theme. Why?

A: This is caused by a long list of links to module issue queues at Drupal.org.
   Just go to Administer >> User management >> Access control >> admin_menu and
   disable the permission "display drupal links" for your or all roles.
   Since uid 1 always has all permissions, this link list cannot be disabled
   for uid 1.

Q: After upgrading to 5.x-2.x, admin_menu disappeared. Why?

A: This should not happen. If it did, visit
   http://<yoursitename>/admin/build/menu to re-generate your menu cache.

Q: Can I configure admin_menu to display another (or the Navigation) menu just
   like the administration menu?

A: No. As the name implies, Drupal Administration Menu is for the administrative
   menu only. However, if you know CSS, you can simply copy'n'paste the contents
   of admin_menu.css into your theme's stylesheet and alter #admin-menu to any
   other menu block id, for example #block-menu-1 or the like.

Q: Sometimes the user counter displays a lot of anonymous users, but when
   comparing the site's statistics (f.e. in Google Analytics) there is no such
   huge amount of users and/or requests reported.

A: If your site was concurrently spidered by search-engine robots, it's commonly
   known to have a giant amount of anonymous users for a short time-frame.
   Most web statistics systems like Google Analytics filter such requests
   already.

Q: After upgrading, admin_menu disappeared. Why?

A: Prior to release 5.x-1.2, Drupal Administration Menu was output in a block.
   Since 5.x-1.2, it is output via hook_footer(). Some custom themes may not
   (yet) output $closure, so admin_menu could no longer be displayed. If you
   decided to move the 'administer' tree into a new menu and disabled that menu
   block, a site could become (temporarily) unmaintainable. Either way, you
   should fix your theme by adding the following code in front of the closing
   HTML (</html>) tag:
<code>
   <?php echo $closure; ?>
</code>

Q: After upgrading, the menu item 'administer' is no longer removed. Why?

A: Prior to release 5.x-1.2, Drupal Administration Menu was output via
   hook_block(), which allowed to alter the global menu array. Since 5.x-1.2, it
   is output via hook_footer() and thus no longer able to alter the menu. As
   long as there will be no built-in solution in an upcoming release, you may
   perform the following steps as a workaround:
   - Create a new menu.
   - Edit the menu item 'administer' and select the new menu as parent.

Q: I enabled "Aggregate and compress CSS files", but I found admin_menu.css is
   still there, is it normal?

A: Yes, this is the intended behavior. Since admin_menu is only visible for
   logged-on administrative users, it would not make sense to load its
   stylesheet for all, including anonymous users.
